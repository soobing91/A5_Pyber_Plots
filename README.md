## Assignment 5 Pyber - Soo Bin

For this assignment, I created a bubble plot that demonstrates average fare per total number of rides for each city. Moreover, several pie charts that show proportions of each city type by total fares, total rides, and total drivers are also created to study the relationships between indices. For codes and charts, please refer to pyber_SooBin.ipynb. For images, refer to "images" folder.<br/>
<br>
The main observations for the analysis are as follows:<br/>
1. Average fare is in rural cities is the highest when compared to that of other city types.<br>
2. There is an inverse relationship between average fare and number of rides. In other words, lower average fare is observed where more rides are available.<br/>
3. Urban cities have the most drivers and most number of rides.
